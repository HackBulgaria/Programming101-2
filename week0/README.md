# Introduction to Python, Linux and Editor

In this week we're going to introduce you to the tools you're going to use during the course and hopefully also after that!


## Python

Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language
that can be applied to many different classes of problems, says [Guido van Rossum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).


But we think it's perfect for the course's goals because it's:
* simple,
* verbose,
* dynamic,
* powerful,
* has a good community

At the end of the week 0 you should be familiar with the Python syntax.


## Linux

Linux is the de facto programming OS. It's Unix-based and open-source.
It's author is [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).

Reasons for using Linux:
* free
* open-source
* unix shell
* unix tooling


The most popular linux distributions are Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Fedora and openSUSE.


We're going to use [Ubuntu 14.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), which is based on Debian and has the largest community
and fewest drivers problems ;).

## TL;DR

Head over to [setup.md](setup.md), it will help you setup your programming environment.
