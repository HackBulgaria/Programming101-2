# How to git?

For the purpose of this course we are going to use git. To learn the basics of this source control system we recommend this tutorial: [Try github.io](https://try.github.io/)

As we are going to talk about public and private keys. You have two choices:
- Watch [this series of 8 videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lICOtR078Gw) to understand cryptography 
- Be dumb till the rest of your life

If you have chosen the second option just leave the course.
If you have chosen the first option then you already know what is public and private key. So you may give it to GitHub by following this tutorial: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

You should get to master level with git so we recommend you this materials: http://scotch.io/bar-talk/git-cheat-sheet
