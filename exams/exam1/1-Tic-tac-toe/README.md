## Problem 8 - A tic-tac-toe game

For a reference of the rules, check here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

__This time, we are not going to give you any specification for the python module.__

Just some requirements:

* The game should be playable by one player.
* We need an Artificial Intelligence
* Player always starts first
* There should be a way, to represent the board as a string and print it
* The game should end, when the player or the AI wins.

__Write tests for the Artificial Intelligence!__

Make your functions testable. Split your code to logic and visualization!

Think about the problem. What kind of functions are you going to need?
