The second issue of the Programming 101 course which covers Python, Linux and Git. The course is part of [HackBulgaria](http://hackbulgaria.com).
The course syllabus in bulgarian can be seen [here](https://hackbulgaria.com/course/Prog101-2/).


## How to use this repository

This repo will include weeks, exams, tasks and solutions for the course.


They'll be separated like:

* Weeks - `^week\d+`, ex. week0, week1 and etc.

* Exams will be grouped in one folder `exams`, that will contain folders of the exams - `^exams/exam\d+`,
ex. `exams/exam1`, `exams/exam1` and etc.

* Tasks may be in week or exam folders - `^(week\d|exam\d)/(\d-.+)`, ex. `week0/1-Hello-World`, `exam1/5-Python-Party`


**Every folder** will have a `README.md` file, but **weeks may also have** `materials.md` files that serve as pre-reading material,
for that week.
