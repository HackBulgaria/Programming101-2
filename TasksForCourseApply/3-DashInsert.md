# DashInsert

You have to implement a function with the following signature - `dashInsert(num)`

* The argument `num` is of type integer.
* The function should return a string


Insert dashes `'-'` between each two neighboring odd numbers in `num`. 

Don't count zero as an odd number.

**You can use any language you know.**

Examples:

```python
dashInsert(99946)
"9-9-946"
dashInsert(56730)
"567-30"
```
