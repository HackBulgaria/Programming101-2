# ExOH

Implement a function with the following signature: `ExOh(str)`

`str` is of type string.

The function should return `true` if there is an **equal number of x's and o's** in `str`.
It should return `false` otherwise.

Things to know:

* Only these two letters will be entered in the string, no punctuation or numbers. 
* You don't have to check for valid input.
* **You can use any language you know.**

Examples:

```python
ExOh('xoxoox') # true
ExOh('oooxoo') # false
```
