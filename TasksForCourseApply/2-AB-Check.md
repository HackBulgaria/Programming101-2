# AB Check

You have the implement the function ABCheck(str) take the str parameter being passed and return true if the characters a and b are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once.
(ie. "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a and b). Otherwise return false. 
You can use any language you know.

Example:
```
Input = "after badly"Output = "false"
Input = "Laura sobs"Output = "true" 
```
