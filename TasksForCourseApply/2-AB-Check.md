# AB Check

You have the implement a function, with the following signature: `ABCheck(str)`.


The argument `str` is of type string.

The function should return `true` if the characters `a` and `b` **are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once.**

Otherwise return `false`

For example - `"lane borrowed"` would result in `true` because **there is exactly three characters between `a` and `b`**. .

**You can use any language you know.**

Examples:

```python
ABCheck("after badly") # false
ABCheck("Laura sobs") # true
```
